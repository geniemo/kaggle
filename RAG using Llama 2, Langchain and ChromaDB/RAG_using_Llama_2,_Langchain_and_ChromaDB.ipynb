        "\n",
        "LLMs has proven their ability to understand context and provide accurate answers to various NLP tasks, including summarization, Q&A, when prompted. While being able to provide very good answers to questions about information that they were trained with, they tend to hallucinate when the topic is about information that they do \"not know\", i.e. was not included in their training data. Retrieval Augmented Generation combines external resources with LLMs. The main two components of a RAG are therefore a retriever and a generator.\n",
        "\n",
        "The retriever part can be described as a system that is able to encode our data so that can be easily retrieved the relevant parts of it upon querying it. The encoding is done using text embeddings, i.e. a model trained to create vector representation of the information. The best option for implementing a retriever is a vector database. As vector database, there are multiple options, both open source or commercial products. Few examples are ChromaDB, Mevius, FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate. Our option in this Notebook will be a local instance of ChromaDB(persistent).\n",
        "\n",
        "For the generator part, the obvious option is a LLM. In this notebook we will use a quantized LLaMA v2 model, from the Kaggle Models collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "The orchestration of the retriever and generator will be done using Langchain. A specialized function from Langchain allows us to create the retriever-generator in one line of code."

That is what we are doing again. Two years ago, our economy was reeling. As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years. Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much. Today, COVID no longer controls our lives. And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken. As we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities. You know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together.

Where is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again? For too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs. Now, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs. Inflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies. But we’re better positioned than any country on Earth. We have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down. Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.
